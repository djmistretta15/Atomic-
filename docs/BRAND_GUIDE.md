# ATOMIC Brand Guide

**Matter. Pattern. Purpose.**

## Brand DNA

### Positioning

ATOMIC exists at the intersection of **science, art, and social impact**. We make the invisible visible—turning microscopic phenomena into wearable art that funds the next generation of scientists.

**We are NOT:**
- Generic science apparel
- Fast fashion with science themes
- Educational products masquerading as streetwear

**We ARE:**
- Premium streetwear with authentic scientific provenance
- A funding mechanism for STEM education disguised as fashion
- A community of people who "look closer"

---

## Brand Personality

### Voice Attributes

1. **Curious** — We ask "What if you could see salt crystals at 1000x?"
2. **Precise** — We cite magnification, technique, and taxonomy
3. **Purposeful** — Every product explicitly states its impact allocation
4. **Elevated but accessible** — We don't dumb down science, but we explain it clearly
5. **Rooted in place** — Long Island is our home; local specimens matter

### Tone

- **Educational without being preachy**
- **Confident without being arrogant**
- **Excited about science without being childish**
- **Transparent about impact without being performative**

## Messaging Framework

### Tagline

**Primary:** "Matter. Pattern. Purpose."

**Alternate:**
- "Built for those who look closer."
- "See the unseen."
- "Wear science. Fund education."

### Value Propositions

1. **Authenticity**
   - "Every design is a real microscope photograph—actual science you can wear."

2. **Provenance**
   - "Each piece includes a specimen card and QR code linking to the exact imaging session, contributor, and scientific context."

3. **Impact**
   - "100% of profits fund STEM scholarships, research grants, and educational programs. You're not just buying a shirt—you're funding the next generation of scientists."

4. **Community**
   - "Join researchers, students, educators, and science supporters who wear their curiosity."

### Product Description Template

```
[HOOK - What you're seeing]
You've [seen/touched] [substance] a million times, but never like this. At [magnification], [substance] reveals [visual phenomenon].

[SCIENCE - What's actually happening]
[Explanation of structure, formation, or phenomenon—2-3 sentences with specifics]

[FIELD NOTE - Why it matters]
[Broader scientific or philosophical insight—1-2 sentences]

[IMPACT - Where your money goes]
[X]% of this product funds [specific program].
```

**Example:**

> You walk past it every day. At 500x under SEM, a Morpho butterfly wing reveals microscopic tree-like scales—nature's nanoengineering that creates blue without blue pigment.
>
> The secret is structural coloration: ridges spaced 200 nanometers apart reflect only blue wavelengths through interference. It's the same principle behind anti-reflective coatings and optical fibers.
>
> **Field Note:** Evolution solved problems engineers are still catching up to.
>
> **Impact:** 20% funds the STEM Youth Summer Program.

## Specimen Card System

Every product includes a **Specimen Card**—a scientific label printed on the garment or included as a physical insert.

### Required Elements

1. **Specimen Code** (e.g., `SPEC-LI-DIATOM-001`)
2. **Common Name** (e.g., "Diatom Colony")
3. **Scientific Name/Composition** (e.g., *Bacillariophyceae* spp., SiO₂)
4. **Technique** (e.g., "Brightfield Microscopy, 400x")
5. **Location** (e.g., "Long Island Sound, NY")
6. **Contributor** (e.g., "Dr. Sarah Moore, Marine Lab")
7. **QR Code** → `/impact/{SKU}`

### Visual Style

- White text on dark overlay (primary navy at 90% opacity)
- Monospace font for technical data
- Grid background (subtle)
- Logo in corner
